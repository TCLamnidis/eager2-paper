## Conclusion

nf-core/eager is an efficient, portable, and accessible pipeline for processing
ancient DNA genomic data. The re-implementation with nextflow and nf-core
will improve reproducibility and inclusion of rapidly increasing ancient DNA
datasets, for both large and small laboratories. Extensive documentation also
allow newcomers to the field get a practical understanding on how to interpret
ancient DNA in the context of NGS data processing. Finally nf-core/eager brings
in the latest tools and routine screening analysis commonly used in the field,
and sets up the pipeline staying at the forefront of palaeogenetic analysis.
