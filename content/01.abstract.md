## Abstract {.page_break_before}

The broadening utilization of ancient DNA (aDNA) to address anthropological,
palaeontological and biological questions is resulting in a rising diversity in
the size of laboratories and scale of analyses being performed. In the context
of this heterogeneous landscape, we present
[nf-core/eager](https://github.com/nf-core/eager), an advanced and entirely
redesigned pipeline for the analysis of ancient DNA genomic data. nf-core/eager
builds on existing ideas and concepts introduced in the original EAGER
pipeline @doi:10.1186/s13059-016-0918-z, and improves various aspects of the
analysis procedure by building on computational frameworks such as
Nextflow @doi:10.1038/nbt.3820 and nf-core @doi:10.1038/s41587-020-0439-x.
The pipeline aims to address three main points: adaptability to different
computing configurations, reproducibility to ensure robust analytical standards
in the field, and bring the pipeline up-to-date with the latest routine and ancient
genomic practises. This new version of EAGER has been developed within the
nf-core initiative, to ensure high quality software development and maintenance
support; contributing to a long-term lifecycle for the pipeline. nf-core/eager
will assist in ensuring that ancient DNA sequencing data can be utilised by a diverse range of
research groups and fields.
